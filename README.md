# BranchAndXSolver

BranchAndXSolver class, which implements the Solver interface for a Relaxation-Agnostic Branch and X Solver within the SMS++ framework. 

## Getting started

These instructions will let you build BranchAndXSolver on your system.


### Requirements

- The [SMS++ core library](https://gitlab.com/smspp/smspp) and its
  requirements.


### Build and install with CMake

Still to be implemented.

### Usage with CMake

Still to be implemented.

### Build and install with makefiles

Carefully hand-crafted makefiles have also been developed for those unwilling
to use CMake. General instructions are:

- The arrangements of folders must be that envisioned by the
  [Umbrella SMS++ Project](https://gitlab.com/smspp/smspp-project)

- The main step is to edit the makefiles into ../extlib/. There is one for
  each of the external libraries that any module requires, starting with

  = [Boost](https://www.boost.org)

  = [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org)

  = [netCDF-C++](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf)

  that are required by the "core" SMS++ library and therefore by everyone.
  Setting the

```make
lib*INC = -I<paths to include files directories>
lib*LIB = -L<paths to lib files directories> -l<libs>
```

  in each allows one to set any non-standard path if the library is not
  installed in the system (or leave them empty if they are).

- The "core" SMS++ classes have a makefile for building the corresponding
  library in

```sh
SMS++/lib/makefile-lib
```

  The makefile allow to choose the compiler name and the optimization/debug.
  This builds the lib/libSMS++.a that can be linked upon. Also, the

```sh
SMS++/lib/makefile-inc
```

  file is provided for allowing external makefiles to ensure that the library
  is up-to-date (useful in case one is actually developing it). The simplest
  way to learn how to use it is to check the makefiles of the "main" file

```sh
Main/makefile
```

  Note that the "basic" makefile macros

```make
CC =
SW =
```

  for setting the c++ compiler and its options are "automatically forwarded"
  from the makefile to these of the other SMS++ components, and therefore
  (possibly at the cost of a make clean) ensure consistency during the
  building process.
